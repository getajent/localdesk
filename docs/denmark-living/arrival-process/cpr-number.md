## Overview

The **CPR-nummer** (civil registration number) is Denmark's unique personal identification number assigned to every resident. This ten-digit number is essential for accessing Danish services including healthcare, banking, employment, housing, and all interactions with Danish authorities. If you plan to stay in Denmark for more than 3 months, obtaining a CPR number is mandatory.

## Key Information

- **Who needs this**: Anyone staying in Denmark for more than 3 months (6 months for some EU/EEA citizens)
- **When to do this**: After securing a permanent address and meeting the minimum residency requirement
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Permanent address in Denmark (must have resided there for 1-3 months depending on municipality)
  - Valid residence permit or EU residence document (if applicable)
  - Valid passport or personal ID
- **Processing time**: CPR number issued immediately at appointment; health insurance card arrives 2-3 weeks later
- **Cost**: Free

## What is a CPR Number?

The CPR number consists of ten digits in the format DDMMYY-SSSS:
- **First six digits**: Your date of birth (day, month, year)
- **Last four digits**: A unique sequence number that identifies you individually
  - The first digit of the sequence encodes your century of birth
  - The last digit indicates gender (odd for males, even for females)

## Why You Need a CPR Number

A CPR number is required for essential activities in Denmark:

- **Employment**: Receiving salary payments from your employer
- **Banking**: Opening a Danish bank account and transferring money
- **Healthcare**: Accessing doctors, hospitals, and receiving your health insurance card
- **Housing**: Securing rental agreements and registering utilities
- **Insurance**: Obtaining insurance policies
- **Government services**: Accessing tax services, social benefits, and digital government platforms
- **Education**: Enrolling in schools or receiving student support (SU)

Without a CPR number, you cannot fully participate in Danish society or access most essential services.

## Common Questions

### Can I work in Denmark without a CPR number?

For short-term work (less than 3 months), you can receive a tax number instead of a CPR number. However, for stays longer than 3 months, a CPR number is mandatory for employment and receiving salary.

### What if I don't have a permanent address yet?

You cannot apply for a CPR number without a permanent address. You must first secure housing, sign a rental contract, and reside at the address for the required period (typically 1-3 months) before applying.

### How long does it take to get a CPR number?

The CPR number is issued immediately during your registration appointment. However, your health insurance card will arrive by mail 2-3 weeks later.

### Do I need to register if I'm only staying for 2 months?

No. If your stay is less than 3 months, you should not register for a CPR number. Short-term workers may receive a tax number for employment purposes.

### Can I apply online?

No. CPR registration requires an in-person appointment at an International Citizen Service center or local Citizen Service center. You must present original documents and complete the registration face-to-face.

### What if I'm from a Nordic country?

Nordic citizens (Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) do not need an EU residence document. You can live, study, and work freely in Denmark. However, you still need a CPR number if staying longer than 3 months. Bring your social security number from your home country to the registration appointment.

### Can I register my family at the same time?

Yes. If you have a spouse or children (under 18) accompanying you, you should make a joint application and register everyone together at the same appointment.

## Important Deadlines

- **3-month minimum stay**: You must intend to stay in Denmark for more than 3 consecutive months to be eligible
- **Registration timing**: Register as soon as you meet the eligibility criteria (permanent address + minimum residency period)
- **No specific deadline**: However, you cannot access essential services without a CPR number, so register as early as possible

## Troubleshooting

### My rental contract is temporary or short-term

**Problem**: You have temporary housing or a short-term rental agreement  
**Solution**: The municipality needs to verify you have a permanent address with sufficient duration. Contact your local ICS center to discuss your specific situation. Some municipalities may accept temporary contracts if you can demonstrate intent to stay long-term.

### I don't have all required documents

**Problem**: Missing documents like birth certificates or marriage certificates  
**Solution**: Contact your home country's embassy or consulate in Denmark to obtain certified copies. You may also request documents from authorities in your home country. The ICS center can advise on acceptable alternatives.

### My residence permit is still being processed

**Problem**: You're waiting for final approval from SIRI  
**Solution**: You typically need the approved residence permit before CPR registration. However, in some cases, an approval letter may be sufficient. Contact the ICS center to confirm what documentation they will accept.

### What if my CPR registration is rejected?

If your application is rejected, the Citizen Service center will explain the reason. Common issues include:
- Insufficient proof of permanent address
- Missing required documents
- Not meeting the 3-month minimum stay requirement
- Invalid or expired residence permits

You can reapply once you resolve the issue. Contact the ICS center for guidance on what additional documentation or steps are needed.
