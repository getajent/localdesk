## Overview

The **sundhedskort** (health insurance card), commonly known as the "yellow card" due to its distinctive yellow color, is your proof of entitlement to healthcare services in Denmark. This card is automatically issued when you register for a CPR number and provides access to Denmark's universal healthcare system, including GP visits, hospital treatment, and specialist care. The card displays your name, address, CPR number, and assigned family doctor (GP).

## Key Information

- **Who needs this**: Anyone registered in the Danish Civil Registration System (CPR) who intends to stay in Denmark for more than 3 months
- **When to do this**: Automatically issued 2-3 weeks after CPR registration; no separate application required
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - CPR number (civil registration number)
  - Registered address in Denmark
  - Name clearly displayed on your mailbox
- **Processing time**: 2-4 weeks after CPR registration
- **Cost**: Free (replacement cards cost DKK 220)

## What is the Health Insurance Card?

The yellow health insurance card is your documentation that you are entitled to services under the Danish national health insurance scheme. The card contains:

- **Your full name**
- **Your address** in Denmark
- **Your CPR number** (civil registration number)
- **Your assigned GP's name and address** (for Group 1 insurance)
- **Your health insurance group** (Group 1 or Group 2)

The card serves as proof that you can receive medical treatment in:
- **Denmark** (all regions)

- **Faroe Islands**

You must present this card when visiting your GP, specialists, hospitals, or pharmacies to access healthcare services and receive prescriptions.

## How to Get Your Health Insurance Card

### Automatic Issuance Process

The health insurance card is issued automatically when you register for a CPR number. There is no separate application process.

#### Steps

1. **Register for CPR number**
   - Complete CPR registration at International Citizen Service (ICS) or Citizen Service center
   - Provide all required documents (passport, proof of address, residence permit if applicable)
   - Receive your CPR number immediately at the appointment

2. **Ensure your name is on your mailbox**
   - **Critical**: Your surname or c/o name must be clearly displayed on your letterbox
   - The health insurance card is sent by regular post and cannot be delivered without a name on the mailbox
   - Use a label, sticker, or nameplate to display your name clearly

3. **Wait for card delivery**
   - The yellow card is automatically mailed to your registered CPR address
   - Delivery time: 2-4 weeks after CPR registration
   - The card arrives by regular post (not registered mail)

4. **Receive your health insurance card**
   - Check your mailbox regularly during the 2-4 week period
   - The card will show your assigned GP (if Group 1) and your CPR number
   - Keep the card safe and bring it to all medical appointments

### What If You Don't Receive Your Card?

If you haven't received your health insurance card after 4 weeks:

1. **Verify your mailbox**: Ensure your name is clearly displayed
2. **Check your registered address**: Confirm your CPR address is correct
3. **Contact Citizen Service**: Visit or call your local Citizen Service center (Borgerservice)
4. **Order a replacement**: You can order a new card online or at Citizen Service

## Understanding Health Insurance Groups

Denmark offers two types of health insurance coverage: Group 1 and Group 2. When you register for a CPR number, you are automatically placed in **Group 1** unless you specifically request Group 2.

### Group 1 (Recommended - 98% of Residents)

**Group 1** is the standard health insurance option chosen by over 98% of Danish residents.

#### Features
- **Assigned GP**: You are automatically assigned a specific family doctor (GP) in your area
- **Free GP visits**: All consultations with your assigned GP are completely free
- **Referral system**: Your GP acts as a "gatekeeper" and provides referrals to specialists when needed
- **Free specialist care**: Specialist visits are free with a GP referral
- **Free hospital treatment**: All hospital services are free
- **Prescription subsidies**: Medications are subsidized based on annual spending

#### How It Works
1. **Visit your assigned GP** for all non-emergency medical issues
2. **GP evaluates** your condition and provides treatment or referral
3. **Specialist visits** require a referral from your GP (except for certain specialties like eye doctors, ear-nose-throat specialists, and physiotherapists)
4. **Hospital treatment** is arranged through GP referrals or emergency services

#### Advantages
- **Completely free**: No out-of-pocket costs for GP visits, specialist care, or hospital treatment
- **Continuity of care**: Your GP knows your medical history and coordinates your care
- **Simple system**: Clear pathway from GP to specialist to hospital
- **Preventive care**: Regular check-ups and screenings through your GP

#### Limitations
- **Must use assigned GP**: You cannot freely choose any GP without changing your registration
- **Referral required**: Cannot see specialists directly (except for certain specialties)
- **GP availability**: May need to wait for appointments during busy periods

### Group 2 (Less Than 2% of Residents)

**Group 2** offers more flexibility but requires co-payments for services.

#### Features
- **Free choice of GP**: You can visit any GP without being registered with a specific doctor
- **No referral needed**: Direct access to specialists without GP referral
- **Co-payments required**: You pay the difference between the subsidy and the actual cost of treatment
- **More flexibility**: Freedom to choose healthcare providers

#### How It Works
1. **Visit any GP** without prior registration
2. **Pay co-payment**: The government subsidizes part of the cost; you pay the remainder
3. **Direct specialist access**: Book specialist appointments without referrals
4. **Hospital treatment**: Free hospital services (same as Group 1)

#### Advantages
- **Flexibility**: Choose any GP or specialist
- **No referrals**: Direct access to specialists
- **Second opinions**: Easier to seek multiple medical opinions

#### Disadvantages
- **Co-payments**: You must pay out-of-pocket for the difference between subsidy and actual cost
- **Higher costs**: Can be significantly more expensive than Group 1
- **Less continuity**: No single GP coordinating your care
- **Administrative burden**: More paperwork and payment processing

### Choosing Your Health Insurance Group

**Recommendation**: Choose **Group 1** unless you have specific reasons to prefer Group 2.

- **Group 1** is free, comprehensive, and provides excellent care for the vast majority of residents
- **Group 2** is only beneficial if you strongly prefer flexibility and are willing to pay extra costs

You can change your health insurance group, but there are restrictions:
- **Waiting period**: You must wait 6 months before switching groups
- **Change process**: Contact your municipality's Citizen Service center or use borger.dk

## What Happens Next

### Immediate Benefits (Once You Receive Your Card)
- **Access to GP**: Book appointments with your assigned GP (Group 1) or any GP (Group 2)
- **Emergency care**: Visit emergency rooms and hospitals with your card
- **Prescriptions**: Receive subsidized medications from pharmacies
- **Specialist referrals**: Your GP can refer you to specialists (Group 1)

### Next Steps After Receiving Your Health Insurance Card
1. **Contact your assigned GP**: Introduce yourself and book a general health check-up
2. **Register with your GP's clinic**: Provide contact information and medical history
3. **Understand your coverage**: Familiarize yourself with what services are free and which require co-payments
4. **Order European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)**: If you plan to travel within the EU, order an EHIC for coverage abroad
5. **Keep your card safe**: Store it in your wallet and bring it to all medical appointments

## Common Questions

### Do I need to apply for the health insurance card separately?

No. The yellow health insurance card is automatically issued when you register for a CPR number. There is no separate application process. Simply ensure your name is on your mailbox and wait 2-4 weeks for delivery.

### What if my name is not on my mailbox?

The health insurance card cannot be delivered if your name is not clearly displayed on your mailbox. The postal service will return the card to the sender. Make sure to put your surname or c/o name on your mailbox before your card is sent.

### How long does it take to receive the card?

Typically 2-4 weeks after your CPR registration date. If you haven't received it after 4 weeks, contact your local Citizen Service center.

### Can I use healthcare services before receiving my card?

Yes, but it may be more complicated. You can:
- **Provide your CPR number** verbally to healthcare providers
- **Show your CPR registration confirmation** if you have it
- **Explain you're waiting for your card** to arrive

However, having the physical card makes the process much smoother. For non-emergency situations, it's best to wait for your card to arrive.

### What if I lose my health insurance card?

You can order a replacement card:
- **Online**: Log in to [borger.dk](https://www.borger.dk/) with MitID and order a new card
- **In person**: Visit your local Citizen Service center (Borgerservice)
- **Cost**: DKK 220 for replacement cards (first card is free)
- **Delivery time**: 1-2 weeks for replacement

### Can I change my assigned GP?

Yes, if you're in Group 1, you can change your GP:
- **Reason**: You can change for any reason (moving, dissatisfaction, preference)
- **Frequency**: You can change once every 6 months
- **Process**: Contact your new GP's clinic or use borger.dk to request a change
- **Approval**: The new GP must accept you as a patient

### What is the difference between Group 1 and Group 2?

- **Group 1**: Assigned GP, free care, referrals required (98% of residents)
- **Group 2**: Free choice of GP, co-payments required, no referrals needed (less than 2% of residents)

Most residents choose Group 1 for free, comprehensive care.

### Does the health insurance card work outside Denmark?

The yellow Danish health insurance card works in:
- **Denmark** (all regions)
- **Greenland**
- **Faroe Islands**

For travel to other EU/EEA countries, you need a **European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)**, which you can order separately through borger.dk.

### What if I'm only staying in Denmark for 2 months?

If you're staying less than 3 months, you will not receive a Danish health insurance card. Instead:
- **EU/EEA/Swiss citizens**: Use your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) from your home country
- **Non-EU citizens**: You must have private health insurance that meets Schengen visa requirements

### Can I use my European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) instead?

If you're a short-term visitor (less than 3 months), yes. However, if you're a resident with a CPR number, you should use your Danish yellow health insurance card for all healthcare in Denmark. The EHIC is for temporary visitors, not residents.

### What healthcare services are covered?

With your health insurance card, you have access to:
- **GP visits**: Free (Group 1) or subsidized (Group 2)
- **Specialist care**: Free with referral (Group 1) or subsidized (Group 2)
- **Hospital treatment**: Free for all residents
