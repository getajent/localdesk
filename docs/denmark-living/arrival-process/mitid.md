## Common Questions

### Do I need a CPR number to get MitID?

For full access to Danish services, yes. However, you can get MitID with a **P-code** if you don't have a CPR number yet. P-codes provide limited access and are mainly useful for banking. Most government services require a CPR number.

### What is a P-code and how do I get one?

A P-code is an 8-digit code that replaces your CPR number when setting up MitID. You can request a P-code from:
- Citizen Service (Borgerservice)
- Your Danish bank
- International Citizen Service centers

P-codes can be used up to 3 times and are valid for creating or updating MitID.

### Can I use MitID without a smartphone?

Yes. You can order a **code display** or **code reader** device from mitid.dk or pick one up at Citizen Service. These physical devices generate one-time codes for logging in. Up to 3 devices are free; additional devices cost extra.

### What if my passport scan fails?

Common solutions:
- **Remove glasses** if you're not wearing them in your passport photo
- **Ensure good lighting** (not too bright, not too dark)
- **Hold phone steady** directly in front of your face (no angle)
- **Keep face and phone still** during the scan
- **Try another phone** if repeated failures occur
- **Visit Citizen Service** if app method doesn't work

If your passport photo is old or low quality, the face match may fail. In this case, visit Citizen Service for in-person verification.

### How long does it take to get MitID?

- **App method**: 5-10 minutes (immediate)
- **Bank method**: Varies by bank (same day to a few days)
- **Citizen Service**: 5-10 minutes at appointment (but may wait weeks for appointment)

### Can I help a family member get MitID?

Yes! The MitID app allows you to help others set up MitID using your phone. The person needs:
- Valid passport with chip
- CPR number or P-code
- Their own phone to install the MitID app (or they can order a code display)

You scan their passport with your phone, and they complete the setup on their device.

### What if I lose my phone with MitID?

1. **Block your MitID immediately**: Call MitID support at **33 98 00 10**
2. **Get a new phone**: Purchase or borrow a smartphone
3. **Reactivate MitID**: Download the app and reactivate using your passport or visit Citizen Service
4. **Use backup code display**: If you have one, use it to access services while resolving phone issues

### Can I use MitID outside Denmark?

Yes, MitID works internationally. You can log in to Danish services from anywhere in the world using the app or code display. However, some services may have geographic restrictions.

### What's the difference between MitID and NemID?

**NemID** was Denmark's old digital identity system (discontinued in 2021). **MitID** is the replacement with improved security, easier setup, and better mobile support. If you still have NemID, you should switch to MitID as soon as possible. NemID is no longer supported.

## Important Deadlines

- **No specific deadline**: However, MitID is essential for accessing most Danish services
- **Set up early**: Get MitID as soon as you have a CPR number to avoid delays in accessing banking, healthcare, and government services
- **NemID discontinued**: If you still use NemID, switch to MitID immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Passport/ID Card Scan Fails

**Problem**: The app cannot read your passport chip or match your face  
**Solution**:
- Verify your passport has a chip symbol (rectangle with circle inside)
- Ensure passport is not expired
- Try in different lighting conditions (avoid too bright or too dark)
- Remove glasses if not wearing them in passport photo
- Hold phone directly in front of face (no angle)
- Keep phone and face completely still during scan
- Try with another phone if available
- If repeated failures, visit Citizen Service for in-person setup

### Cannot Download MitID App

**Problem**: App not available in your country's app store  
**Solution**:
- Change your App Store/Google Play region to Denmark temporarily
- Or visit Citizen Service to set up MitID with a code display instead

### Forgot MitID Password or PIN

**Problem**: Cannot remember your PIN code or password  
**Solution**:
- **For app users**: Use biometric login (fingerprint/Face ID) if enabled
- **For code display**: Log in to mitid.dk with your app and reset password
- **If completely locked out**: Contact MitID support at 33 98 00 10 or visit Citizen Service

### Code Display Blocked

**Problem**: Entered wrong code too many times  
**Solution**:
- **After 3 incorrect attempts**: Temporarily blocked - call MitID support at 33 98 00 10 for activation code
- **After 6 incorrect attempts**: Permanently blocked - order a new code display
- **Note**: If you changed your phone number in the last 5 days, MitID support cannot provide activation code - visit Citizen Service instead

### MitID Not Accepted for a Service

**Problem**: A service rejects your MitID login  
**Solution**:
- **Check assurance level**: Some services require "Substantial" or "High" assurance level
- **Verify CPR number**: Most government services require MitID with CPR number (not P-code)
- **Update identity verification**: You may need to verify your identity again with passport or at Citizen Service
- **Contact service provider**: Some private services may have additional requirements

### What if my MitID application is rejected?

If you cannot get MitID, common reasons include:
- **Invalid or expired documents**: Ensure passport/ID is current and has chip
- **Face match failure**: Passport photo too old or low quality - visit Citizen Service
- **No CPR number or P-code**: Obtain CPR number first or request P-code
- **Technical issues**: Try again later or use alternative method (bank or Citizen Service)

Contact MitID support or visit Citizen Service for personalized assistance.
