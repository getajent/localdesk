Understanding your rental contract and tenant rights is essential for securing and maintaining housing in Denmark, whether you're renting privately, through housing associations, or on waiting lists.

## Common Questions

### Do I need a CPR number to rent an apartment?

Most landlords require a CPR number, especially for long-term rentals and housing association properties. Some private landlords may rent to you before you have a CPR number, but this is less common. Consider temporary housing or sublets while obtaining your CPR number.

### Can my landlord increase rent whenever they want?

No. Rent increases are regulated by law and typically limited to once per year, tied to the net price index (usually 1-3% annually). Landlords must give proper notice (usually 3 months) and you can challenge excessive increases through the Rent Tribunal.

### What if my landlord doesn't fix maintenance issues?

Document the issue in writing, set a reasonable deadline, and follow up. For urgent health/safety issues, landlords must respond immediately. If they don't, you may be able to arrange repairs and deduct costs from rent (with proper documentation), or file a complaint with Huslejenævnet.

### Can I sublet my apartment?

Only with your landlord's written permission. Subletting without permission can result in eviction. If you need to sublet temporarily (e.g., studying abroad), request permission in writing and explain the circumstances.

### How long are waiting lists for social housing?

Wait times vary significantly by location. Copenhagen center can be 5-10+ years, while smaller cities may be 6 months to 2 years. Register on multiple waiting lists as soon as possible to accumulate waiting time.

### What happens if I need to break my lease early?

Review your contract's termination clause. You typically must give the required notice period and pay rent during that time. Some contracts allow early termination with penalty. You may be able to find a replacement tenant with landlord approval.

### Can my landlord refuse to rent to me because I have children?

Generally no. Danish law prohibits discrimination based on family status. However, some properties may have legitimate restrictions (e.g., size limitations, building rules). If you believe you've been discriminated against, you can file a complaint.

### Do I need rental insurance?

While not legally required, **indboforsikring** (tenant insurance) is highly recommended and often required by landlords. It covers your belongings and liability for damage to the rental property. See [Tenant Insurance](./tenant-insurance.md) for details.

## Important Deadlines

- **Notice period**: Typically 1-3 months for tenants, 3-6 months for landlords (check your contract)
- **Rent payment**: Due on date specified in contract (usually 1st of month)
- **Challenge rent increase**: Within 6 weeks of receiving notice
- **Report maintenance issues**: Immediately for urgent issues, promptly for non-urgent
- **Deposit return**: Landlord should return within 4-6 weeks after move-out

## Troubleshooting

### I can't afford the upfront costs

**Options**:
- Negotiate payment plan with landlord (rare but possible)
- Look for rooms or shared housing (lower deposits)
- Consider temporary housing while saving
- Some housing associations have lower deposit requirements
- Student housing may have reduced deposits

### The contract is only in Danish and I don't understand it

**Solutions**:
- Use online translation tools (Google Translate, DeepL)

- Ask Danish-speaking friend or colleague to review
- Contact International Citizen Service for guidance
- Don't sign until you understand all terms

### I think I'm being scammed

**Warning signs**:
- Can't meet landlord in person
- Pressure to pay before viewing
- No written contract
- Price too good to be true

**Actions**:
- Stop communication immediately
- Don't send money
- Report to police if you've been defrauded
- Verify property ownership through public records
- Use reputable rental platforms

### My landlord is entering without notice

**Your rights**:
- Landlord must give reasonable notice (except emergencies)
- You have right to privacy and peaceful enjoyment

**Actions**:
- Document incidents (dates, times)
- Send written notice reminding landlord of legal requirements
- If continues, file complaint with Huslejenævnet
