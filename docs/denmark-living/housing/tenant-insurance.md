## Common Questions

### Is tenant insurance legally required in Denmark?

No, indboforsikring is not legally required by Danish law. However, most landlords require it as a condition of the rental agreement, and it's highly recommended for financial protection.

### How much coverage do I need?

Estimate the replacement value of all your belongings (furniture, electronics, clothing, etc.). Most people need 300,000-500,000 DKK for basic coverage, but this varies based on what you own. Consider higher limits if you have valuable items.

### Does my insurance cover items stolen outside my home?

Many policies include coverage for belongings stolen outside the home (e.g., laptop stolen from café, bicycle theft), but coverage limits may be lower. Check your specific policy for details and consider add-on coverage if needed.

### What is a deductible (selvrisiko)?

The deductible is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before insurance covers the rest. For example, with a 3,000 DKK deductible and 10,000 DKK in damage, you pay 3,000 DKK and insurance pays 7,000 DKK. Higher deductibles mean lower premiums.

### Can I get insurance without a CPR number?

Most Danish insurance companies require a CPR number. If you don't have one yet, some providers may offer temporary coverage, or you might need to use international insurance until you receive your CPR number.

### Does insurance cover damage I cause to the rental property?

Yes, the liability portion of indboforsikring covers accidental damage you cause to the rental property (e.g., fire, water damage, broken fixtures). This is one reason landlords require it.

### Will filing a claim increase my premium?

Filing claims can affect your premium at renewal, especially multiple claims. However, this shouldn't prevent you from filing legitimate claims for significant losses. Many insurers offer no-claims bonuses for years without claims.

### Can I get a discount as a student?

Yes, many insurance companies offer student discounts of 10-20%. You'll need to provide proof of enrollment (student ID or enrollment certificate). Some providers specialize in student insurance with lower rates.

### What if I share an apartment with roommates?

Each person should have their own indboforsikring to cover their personal belongings. Liability coverage typically only covers the policyholder and their family members, not unrelated roommates.

### Does insurance cover my bicycle?

Basic indboforsikring may cover bicycle theft from your home, but coverage for theft outside (e.g., from bike rack) usually requires additional bicycle insurance. Many providers offer bicycle coverage as an add-on.

## Important Deadlines

- **Get insurance**: Before or immediately after moving in
- **Provide proof to landlord**: As required by rental contract (usually at move-in)

- **Cancellation notice**: Typically 30 days before desired end date
- **Annual renewal**: Review policy before automatic renewal

## Troubleshooting

### My claim was denied

**Common reasons for denial**:
- Damage not covered by policy

**What to do**:
- Request detailed explanation in writing

- Provide additional documentation if available
- Appeal decision if you believe it's wrong

### I can't afford the premium

**Options**:
- Choose higher deductible to lower premium
- Reduce coverage limits to minimum needed
- Shop for cheaper providers
- Look for student or other discounts
- Pay annually instead of monthly for discount
- Consider basic coverage instead of premium

### My landlord says my insurance isn't sufficient

**Verify requirements**:
- Check rental contract for specific requirements
- Ensure liability coverage meets minimum (usually 1-5 million DKK)
- Provide policy documents to landlord
- If insufficient, upgrade coverage or switch providers

### I forgot to cancel my old insurance when switching

**Actions**:
- Contact old provider immediately to cancel
- Provide cancellation notice in writing
- Request prorated refund for unused coverage
- Ensure no gap in coverage with new provider
- Set reminder for future renewals

### I need to file a claim but don't speak Danish
