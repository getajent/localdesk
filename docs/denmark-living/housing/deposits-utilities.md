## Overview

When renting accommodation in Denmark, tenants must pay a **depositum** (security deposit) and often **forudbetalt husleje** (prepaid rent) before moving in. Additionally, tenants are responsible for setting up and paying for various utilities including electricity, water, heating, and internet. Understanding deposit regulations and utility setup procedures is essential for budgeting and ensuring a smooth move-in process.

## Key Information

- **Who needs this**: All tenants renting accommodation in Denmark
- **When to arrange**: Before moving in (deposits) and immediately after moving in (utilities)
- **Typical upfront costs**: 6-7 months' rent (deposit + prepaid rent + first month)
- **Utility setup time**: 1-2 weeks for most services
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - CPR number (for most utilities)
  - Bank account (NemKonto)
  - Rental contract

## Security Deposit (Depositum)

### What is a Depositum?

A **depositum** is a security deposit paid to the landlord before moving in to cover potential damages or unpaid rent. The deposit is held by the landlord during your tenancy and returned when you move out, minus any legitimate deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear.

### Legal Regulations

**Maximum deposit amount**:
- **Up to 3 months' rent** for unfurnished apartments
- **Up to 6 months' rent** for furnished apartments
- Cannot exceed these legal limits

**Interest requirements**:
- Deposits must be held in interest-bearing accounts
- Interest belongs to the tenant
- Landlord must provide account details upon request

**Deposit protection**:
- Deposits are protected by Danish rental law
- Landlord cannot use deposit for normal maintenance
- Tenant has right to dispute unfair deductions

### Paying the Deposit

**When to pay**:
- Before receiving keys and moving in
- After signing rental contract
- Never pay before viewing property or signing contract

**Payment method**:
- Bank transfer to landlord's account
- Get written receipt for all payments
- Keep records of transaction

**Documentation**:
- Receipt showing deposit amount paid
- Confirmation of interest-bearing account
- Copy of rental contract specifying deposit terms

### Deposit Return

**Timeline for return**:
- Landlord should return deposit within reasonable time after move-out
- Typically 4-6 weeks
- Must include interest earned during tenancy

**Deductions allowed**:
- Damage beyond normal wear and tear
- Unpaid rent or utilities
- Cleaning costs if property left excessively dirty
- Repairs for tenant-caused damage

**Deductions NOT allowed**:
- Normal wear and tear (faded paint, minor scuffs, worn carpet)
- General maintenance landlord is responsible for
- Improvements or upgrades
- Excessive or unjustified charges

**If deposit not returned**:
- Request written explanation with itemized deductions
- Provide evidence of property condition at move-out
- Negotiate if disagreement exists
- File complaint with Huslejenævnet (Rent Tribunal)
- Small claims court for unresolved disputes

### Protecting Your Deposit

**At move-in**:

- Document existing damage with photos and video
- Get written move-in report signed by landlord
- Note every defect, no matter how small

**During tenancy**:

## Prepaid Rent (Forudbetalt Husleje)

### What is Prepaid Rent?

**Forudbetalt husleje** is rent paid in advance, typically covering the first 1-3 months of tenancy. This is separate from the security deposit and is applied to your actual rent payments.

### Legal Limits

- **Maximum 3 months' prepaid rent**
- Combined with deposit, total upfront payment can be up to 6 months' rent (3 months deposit + 3 months prepaid)
- Plus first month's rent due at move-in
- **Total upfront cost**: Can be 6-7 months' rent

### How Prepaid Rent Works

**Payment**:
- Paid before moving in, along with deposit
- Applied to first months of tenancy
- Not returned at move-out (already used for rent)

**Example**:
- Monthly rent: 8,000 DKK
- Deposit: 24,000 DKK (3 months)
- Prepaid rent: 16,000 DKK (2 months)
- First month's rent: 8,000 DKK
- **Total upfront**: 48,000 DKK

**Rent payment schedule**:
- Month 1: Covered by prepaid rent
- Month 2: Covered by prepaid rent
- Month 3 onward: Pay monthly rent as normal

- Water and heating: Usually included in rent
- **Total**: 500-1,000 DKK/month for utilities not included in rent

### Can I get my deposit back if I break my lease?

Your deposit is separate from lease obligations. If you break your lease, you may owe rent for the notice period, but your deposit should still be returned (minus any legitimate deductions for damages) after you move out and the property is inspected.

### What if I can't afford the upfront deposit?

Options are limited, but you can:
- Negotiate payment plan with landlord (rare)
- Look for rooms or shared housing (lower deposits)
- Consider temporary housing while saving
- Some housing associations have lower deposit requirements
- Student housing may have reduced deposits

### Do I need to set up utilities before moving in?

Electricity should be set up before or on move-in day to avoid disconnection. Internet can be arranged after moving in, but order early as installation may take 1-2 weeks. Water and heating are usually handled by the landlord.

### Can I choose any electricity provider?

Yes, Denmark has a liberalized electricity market. You can choose any provider and switch providers at any time. Use elpris.dk to compare prices and find the best deal for your needs.

### What happens to my deposit if my landlord sells the property?

Your deposit transfers to the new owner. The new landlord becomes responsible for returning your deposit when you move out. Ensure the deposit transfer is documented in the property sale.

### Is internet included in my rent?

It depends on your rental agreement. Some buildings have collective internet agreements included in rent, while most tenants choose and pay for their own internet service. Check your rental contract.

### How do I know if I need to pay TV license?

If you own a TV, computer, tablet, or smartphone capable of receiving TV broadcasts or streaming, you must pay the TV license (medielicens). It's automatically billed if you're registered with a CPR number, unless you apply for exemption.
