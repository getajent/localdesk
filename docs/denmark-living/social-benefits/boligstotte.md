## Overview

**Boligstøtte** (housing benefits) is Denmark's rent subsidy program that provides monthly financial assistance to eligible residents to help cover housing costs. The benefit is administered by **Udbetaling Danmark** (the Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment) and is available to tenants living in rented accommodation who meet specific income, residency, and housing criteria. The amount of support depends on household income, number of household members, rent amount, and dwelling size.

## Key Information

- **Who needs this**: Tenants in rented accommodation with low to moderate income
- **When to apply**: As soon as you move into eligible rental housing
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - CPR number (civil registration number)
  - Rental accommodation with own kitchen
  - Residence in Denmark on a permanent basis
  - Valid residence permit (for non-EU citizens)
- **Processing time**: Typically 4-6 weeks from application submission
- **Cost**: Free to apply
- **Payment**: Monthly, directly to your bank account (tax-free)

## What is Boligstøtte?

Boligstøtte is a government subsidy designed to reduce the financial burden of housing costs for residents with limited income. The benefit:

- Provides monthly monetary support to help pay rent
- Is calculated based on your specific household circumstances
- Is paid directly to your bank account
- Is not taxed as income
- Covers rent only (not utilities like water, heat, or electricity)
- Can be received even if you are living in Denmark temporarily

The subsidy helps ensure that housing remains affordable for residents across different income levels.

## Eligibility Criteria

### Residency Requirements

To qualify for boligstøtte, you must:

- **Have a CPR number**: You must be registered in the Danish Civil Registration System
- **Live in Denmark permanently**: You must reside at the address on a permanent basis (not temporary stays)
- **Have legal residence status**: 
  - Danish citizens automatically qualify
  - EU/EEA/Swiss citizens with residence registration
  - Non-EU citizens with valid residence permit
- **Minimum rental duration**: Your rental agreement should be for more than 6 months
  - If your stay is shortened, you may need to return the subsidy

### Housing Requirements

Your accommodation must meet these criteria:

- **Rented accommodation**: You must be a tenant (not an owner)
- **Own kitchen or kitchenette**: The dwelling must have private cooking facilities
- **Not living with property owner**: You cannot receive benefits if you live with the landlord
- **Registered address**: The property must be your registered address with your CPR number

**Ineligible housing situations**:
- Living in a room in the owner's home
- Owning the property yourself (even if renting part of it)
- Shared accommodation without own kitchen (e.g., some dorm rooms)
- Subletting without proper rental agreement

### Income and Household Requirements

Boligstøtte is means-tested based on:

- **Household income**: Total income of all wage earners at the address
- **Number of household members**: Adults and children living at the address
- **Wealth**: Significant assets may affect eligibility
- **Number of children**: Families with children may receive higher benefits

**General principle**: The lower your income and the higher your rent, the more support you may receive. As income increases, the benefit amount decreases.

### Who Can Apply?

- **Non-pensioners**: Working-age adults and families
- **Students**: Including international students with appropriate residence permits
- **Unemployed individuals**: Those receiving unemployment benefits or social assistance
- **Low-income workers**: Employed individuals with modest salaries
- **Early retirees**: Those who retired under rules after 2003

**Note**: Old-age pensioners and early retirees (pension granted before January 1, 2003) have a separate housing benefit scheme.

## Calculation Method

The amount of boligstøtte you receive depends on several factors:

### Factors Affecting Benefit Amount

1. **Household income**
   - Total annual income of all household members
   - Lower income = higher benefit
   - Income is assessed based on tax records

2. **Rent amount**
   - Monthly rent payment
   - Higher rent may result in higher benefit (up to limits)
   - Only covers rent, not utilities

3. **Dwelling size**
   - Square meters of the rental unit
   - Larger dwellings may affect benefit calculation

4. **Number of household members**
   - Adults and children living at the address
   - More household members may increase benefit

5. **Wealth and assets**
   - Significant savings or assets may reduce benefit
   - Threshold limits apply

### Benefit Limits

- There are maximum limits on how much boligstøtte you can receive
- The subsidy covers a percentage of your rent, not the full amount
- Specific calculation formulas are complex and handled automatically by Udbetaling Danmark

**Tip**: Use the online calculator on Udbetaling Danmark's website to estimate your potential benefit amount before applying.

## Common Questions

### Can I receive boligstøtte as an international student?

Yes, international students can apply for boligstøtte if they have a CPR number, valid residence permit, and live in eligible rental accommodation with their own kitchen. Eligibility depends on your residence permit type and income.

### How much boligstøtte will I receive?

The amount varies based on your household income, rent, dwelling size, and number of household members. Use the online calculator on Udbetaling Danmark's website to estimate your benefit. Most recipients receive between 500-3,000 DKK per month, but amounts vary widely.

### Can I receive boligstøtte if I share an apartment?

You can receive boligstøtte if you have your own rental contract and your own kitchen or kitchenette. If you live in a shared apartment without your own kitchen (e.g., some dorm rooms), you may not be eligible, or processing may take longer.

### What if I'm only staying in Denmark for 6 months?

You can apply for boligstøtte even for temporary stays, but your rental duration should be more than 6 months. If your stay is shortened and you leave earlier, you may need to return the entire subsidy amount.

### Do I need to speak Danish to apply?

The application system is in Danish, which can be challenging for non-Danish speakers. Consider using online translation tools, asking a Danish-speaking friend for help, or contacting your educational institution or International Citizen Service center for assistance.

### What if I receive too much boligstøtte?

If you are overpaid (due to unreported changes or errors), you must repay the excess amount. Udbetaling Danmark will send you a repayment notice. You can arrange a repayment plan if needed.

### Can I receive boligstøtte and SU (student grants) at the same time?

Yes, you can receive both boligstøtte and SU simultaneously. Your SU income will be considered in the boligstøtte calculation, but receiving SU does not disqualify you from housing benefits.

### How long does it take to receive the first payment?

After your application is approved (typically 4-6 weeks), you will receive your first payment in the following month. For example, if you apply in January and are approved in February, your first payment arrives in March.

## Important Deadlines

- **Apply immediately**: Benefits are not retroactive, so apply as soon as you move into eligible accommodation
- **Report changes within 4 weeks**: Notify Udbetaling Danmark of any changes affecting your benefits within 4 weeks
- **Annual reassessment**: Your benefits are automatically reassessed each year based on updated income data

## Troubleshooting

### My application was rejected

**Common reasons for rejection**:
- No own kitchen or kitchenette in the accommodation
- Income too high relative to rent and household size
- Not registered at the address with CPR number
- Rental duration less than 6 months
- Living with property owner

**Solution**: Review the rejection letter for specific reasons. If circumstances change (e.g., income decreases), you can reapply.

### I haven't received payment

**Possible reasons**:
- Application still being processed (check status online)
- NemKonto not properly registered
- Changes in circumstances affecting eligibility
- Administrative delays

**Solution**: Log in to Udbetaling Danmark's self-service portal to check your case status, or contact them by phone.

### I received a letter in Danish I don't understand

**Problem**: All official correspondence from Udbetaling Danmark is in Danish  
**Solution**: 
- Use online translation tools (Google Translate, DeepL)
- Ask a Danish-speaking friend or colleague for help
- Contact your educational institution's international office
- Seek assistance from International Citizen Service centers

### I need help with the application
