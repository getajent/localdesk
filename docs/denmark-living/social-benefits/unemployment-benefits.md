## Overview

**Dagpenge** (unemployment benefits) is Denmark's unemployment insurance system that provides financial support to eligible workers who lose their jobs. Unlike many countries, unemployment insurance in Denmark is voluntary and administered by private unemployment insurance funds called **A-kasser** (arbejdsløshedskasser). To receive dagpenge, you must be a member of an A-kasse, meet work history requirements, and actively search for new employment. Benefits can amount to up to 90% of your previous salary, subject to maximum limits.

## Key Information

- **Who needs this**: Workers who have lost their jobs and are actively seeking employment
- **When to apply**: Join an A-kasse while employed; apply for benefits immediately after job loss
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - A-kasse membership for at least 12 months
  - Sufficient work history (1,924 hours or minimum income over 3 years)
  - CPR number and residence in Denmark
  - Registration as job seeker at local job center
- **Processing time**: Varies by A-kasse; typically 2-4 weeks after application
- **Benefit duration**: Up to 2 years within a 3-year period
- **Cost**: Monthly A-kasse membership fee (approximately 400-600 DKK, tax-deductible)

## What is the Dagpenge System?

Denmark's unemployment insurance system is unique in that it is:

- **Voluntary**: Not automatic; you must actively join an A-kasse
- **Privately administered**: Run by independent unemployment insurance funds (A-kasser)
- **Contribution-based**: Requires monthly membership fees while employed
- **Work-history dependent**: Eligibility based on previous employment and income

The system provides income replacement for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, allowing them time to search for suitable new employment.

## Common Questions

### Do I automatically get unemployment insurance when I start working?

No. Unemployment insurance is voluntary in Denmark. You must actively join an A-kasse and pay monthly membership fees to be covered.

### When should I join an A-kasse?

Join as soon as you start working in Denmark. You need 12 months of membership before you can receive dagpenge, so joining early ensures you're covered if you lose your job.

### How much does A-kasse membership cost?

Membership fees vary by A-kasse but typically range from 400-600 DKK per month. The fees are tax-deductible, reducing the actual cost.

### Can I receive dagpenge if I quit my job?

Generally, no. Dagpenge is for workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own (e.g., layoffs, company closure). If you quit voluntarily, you typically face a waiting period before eligibility.

### What if I'm self-employed?

Self-employed individuals can join an A-kasse and receive dagpenge if they meet income requirements (at least DKK 233,376 from self-employment and paid employment over 3 years) and close their business.

### Can international workers receive dagpenge?

Yes, if you have a CPR number, valid work authorization, A-kasse membership for 12 months, and meet work history requirements. EU/EEA citizens may aggregate periods from other countries.

### What happens if I get sick while unemployed?

If you become ill while receiving dagpenge, you may be eligible for sickness benefits (sygedagpenge) instead. Contact your A-kasse immediately if you become unable to work due to illness.

### Can I work part-time while receiving dagpenge?

Yes, you can work part-time and receive partial dagpenge. Your benefit amount is reduced based on hours worked, but working extends your benefit period.

## Important Deadlines

- **Join A-kasse**: Within 8 weeks of starting work in Denmark (to avoid gaps in coverage)
- **Register as job seeker**: Immediately upon becoming unemployed
- **Apply for dagpenge**: As soon as you become unemployed (benefits not retroactive)
- **Report changes**: Within 4 weeks of any changes affecting eligibility
- **Return from EU job search**: Before 3-month deadline expires

## Troubleshooting

### I don't meet the 12-month membership requirement

**Problem**: You haven't been an A-kasse member for 12 months  
**Solution**: 
- If you worked in another EU/EEA country, you may aggregate insurance periods
- Otherwise, you must wait until you've been a member for 12 months
- Consider applying for social assistance (kontanthjælp) in the meantime

### I don't meet the work history requirement

**Problem**: Insufficient hours or income over past 3 years  
**Solution**:
- Continue working until you meet the requirement
- If you worked in another EU/EEA country, those periods may count
- Recent graduates have special rules (student membership)

### My dagpenge application was rejected

**Common reasons**:
- Insufficient A-kasse membership duration
- Not meeting work history requirements
- Not registered as job seeker
- Quit job voluntarily (waiting period applies)
- Not available for work

**Solution**: Review rejection letter for specific reasons. Contact your A-kasse for guidance on next steps or appeal process.

### I'm having trouble with job search requirements

**Problem**: Difficulty meeting job application quotas or attending meetings  
**Solution**: 
- Communicate with your job center counselor
- Explain any barriers to job search
- Request accommodations if needed
- Seek help from your A-kasse
