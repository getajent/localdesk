## Overview

**Børne- og ungeydelse** (child and youth benefits), also known as **børnepenge** or **børnecheck**, is Denmark's universal child benefit program that provides tax-free financial support to families with children under 18 years old. The benefit is paid automatically to parents living in Denmark with registered children, or can be applied for by EU/EEA citizens working in Denmark whose children live abroad. Payment amounts vary based on the child's age and are paid quarterly (for children 0-14) or monthly (for youth 15-17).

## Key Information

- **Who receives this**: Parents or guardians of children under 18 registered in Denmark
- **When to apply**: Automatic for residents; application required if child lives abroad
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Child registered in Denmark (or parent working in Denmark for EU/EEA citizens)
  - Residency or work history in Denmark
  - CPR number for parent and child
- **Processing time**: Automatic for residents; 4-6 weeks for applications
- **Payment frequency**: Quarterly (ages 0-14) or monthly (ages 15-17)
- **Tax status**: Tax-free benefit (not counted as income)

## What are Child and Youth Benefits?

Child and youth benefits are government payments designed to help families cover the costs of raising children, including:

- Food and clothing
- Childcare and education expenses
- General living costs for children

The benefit system includes:

- **Børnepenge** (child benefits): For children aged 0-14 years
- **Ungeydelse** (youth benefits): For youth aged 15-17 years

These benefits are universal, meaning all eligible families receive them regardless of income level (though foreign workers have graduated eligibility based on time in Denmark).

## Eligibility Criteria

### For Danish Citizens and Permanent Residents

If you and your child both live in Denmark:

- **Automatic payment**: Benefits are paid automatically when your child is registered
- **No application needed**: Registration happens through the civil registration system
- **Full benefit amount**: Receive 100% of the benefit from birth

### For Foreign Workers in Denmark

2. **Pay taxes in Denmark**: You pay Danish income tax
3. **Residency or work history**: You have lived or worked in Denmark for a certain period within the past 10 years

## Common Questions

### Do I need to apply for child benefits?

If you and your child both live in Denmark, no application is needed - benefits are paid automatically. If your child lives abroad and you work in Denmark, you must apply.

### When will I receive my first payment?

For children born in Denmark, benefits begin from the first quarter after birth. For example, a child born in February will receive the first payment in April (covering April-June).

### Why is the payment split between parents?

Since January 2022, Denmark splits child benefits equally between parents (50% each) to recognize both parents' roles in raising children. If you share a bank account (NemKonto), the full amount goes to that account.

### Can I receive child benefits if I'm on parental leave?

Yes, child benefits are separate from parental leave benefits. You receive both if eligible.

### What if my child lives with me but the other parent lives abroad?

If you and your child live in Denmark, you receive full Danish child benefits. The other parent's location does not affect your eligibility.

### What happens when my child turns 15?

The payment automatically switches from quarterly child benefits to monthly youth benefits. You don't need to do anything - Udbetaling Danmark handles the transition.
