## Overview

**SU** (Statens Uddannelsesstøtte - State Educational Grant and Loan Scheme) is Denmark's public student financial support system that provides monthly grants and optional loans to students enrolled in approved educational programs. Unlike many countries, Denmark offers financial support to all eligible students regardless of social standing, allowing students to study without tuition fees and with government financial assistance. International students can receive SU if they obtain "equal status" with Danish citizens by meeting specific work and residency requirements.

## Key Information

- **When to apply**: After acceptance to education program and obtaining MitID
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - Acceptance to SU-approved education in Denmark

  - CPR number and MitID
  - For international students: Equal status (work requirement)

- **Payment frequency**: Monthly

## What is SU?

SU is Denmark's comprehensive student support system that includes:

### SU Grant (Stipendium)

### Key Principles

Denmark's SU system is based on the principle that:
- **Every Dane over 18** is entitled to public support for education
- **No tuition fees** at Danish educational institutions
- **Education is a right**, not dependent on family wealth or social standing
- **International students** can access SU if they meet equal status requirements

## Common Questions

### Can I work full-time and receive SU?

Yes, you can work full-time and receive SU. However, if your income exceeds certain thresholds, your SU amount may be reduced. The work requirement is a minimum (43 hours/month), not a maximum.

### What if I lose my job while receiving SU?

If you lose your job and were receiving SU based on work (equal status), you must notify the SU agency immediately. Your SU will stop, and you may need to repay benefits received after losing employment. You can reapply once you find new employment meeting the 43-hour requirement.

### Can I receive SU for studying in English-language programs?

Yes, as long as the program is at an SU-approved Danish educational institution. Many Danish universities offer English-language programs that qualify for SU.

### Do I need to repay the SU grant?

No, the SU grant does not need to be repaid. Only the optional SU loan must be repaid after graduation.

### Can I receive SU and work at the same time?

Yes, most international students work part-time (minimum 43 hours/month) to maintain equal status while receiving SU. You can work more than the minimum without losing SU, though very high income may reduce the amount.

### What if I'm doing an unpaid internship as part of my studies?

Unpaid internships do not count toward the 43-hour work requirement. You must have paid employment to maintain equal status and continue receiving SU.

### Can I receive SU during summer break?

Yes, SU continues during summer breaks as long as you remain enrolled in your education program and continue to meet eligibility requirements (including work requirement for international students).

### What happens if I fail exams or don't progress in my studies?

Failing exams or not progressing can affect your SU. You may lose SU months or be required to repay benefits if you don't meet academic progress requirements. Contact your educational institution's SU advisor for guidance.

## Important Deadlines

- **Application deadline**: December 5th for current year
- **Equal status application**: Within 3 weeks of SU application
- **Report changes**: Immediately when circumstances change
- **Earliest application**: 3 months before desired start date
- **January applications**: Available from December 1st of previous year

## Troubleshooting

### My equal status application was rejected

**Common reasons**:
- Insufficient work hours (less than 43 hours/month)
- Unpaid work or internships (don't count)
- Missing or incomplete documentation
- Residence permit type not eligible
- Not meeting continuous work requirement

**Solution**: Review rejection letter for specific reasons. If you can meet requirements (e.g., get paid employment with 43+ hours/month), you can reapply.

### I haven't received my SU payment

**Possible reasons**:
- Application still being processed
- NemKonto not properly registered
- Tax card issues (high tax deduction)
- Changes in circumstances not reported
- Work hours dropped below 43/month

**Solution**: Log in to minSU to check payment status. Verify NemKonto registration. Contact SU agency if payment is delayed.

### I received too much SU and need to repay

**Problem**: Overpayment due to unreported changes or errors  
**Solution**:
- You will receive a repayment notice from SU agency
- Repayment plan can be arranged
- Interest may be charged on overpayments
- Report changes promptly to avoid future overpayments

### I don't understand the letters from SU agency

**Problem**: Correspondence is in Danish  
**Solution**:
- Use online translation tools (Google Translate, DeepL)
- Ask your educational institution's international office for help
- Contact SU agency for English-language assistance
- Seek help from Danish-speaking friends or classmates
