## Overview

A **skattekort** (tax card) is an electronic document that tells your employer how much tax to withhold from your salary each month. The tax card is essential for anyone working in Denmark, as it ensures the correct amount of tax is deducted from your income. Without a properly configured tax card, you may be taxed at a higher rate or face tax adjustments at the end of the year. The tax card system is managed by **SKAT** (Danish Tax Authority) and is accessed through the TastSelv online portal.

## Key Information

- **Who needs this**: Anyone earning employment income in Denmark
- **When to do this**: Immediately after receiving your CPR number and before starting work
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - CPR number (civil registration number)
  - MitID (for online access to TastSelv)
  - Employment contract or job offer
- **Processing time**: Tax card is available immediately online; changes take effect within 1-2 days
- **Cost**: Free

## What is a Tax Card?

The tax card is an electronic record in SKAT's system that contains:
- Your personal allowance (**personfradrag**)
- Your tax deduction percentage
- Information about which employer should use which tax card
- Any special deductions or adjustments

Your employer accesses your tax card electronically through SKAT's system and uses it to calculate monthly tax deductions from your salary.

## Types of Tax Cards

Denmark has two types of tax cards for different employment situations:

### 1. Main Tax Card (Hovedkort)

The **hovedkort** (main tax card) is used for your primary employment and offers the most favorable tax treatment.

**Features**:
- Includes your full personal allowance (~49,700 DKK per year in 2025)
- Lowest tax deduction rate
- Should be assigned to your main employer (highest income source)
- Only one hovedkort can be active at a time

**Typical tax rate**: 37-42% (varies by municipality and income)

### 2. Secondary Tax Card (Bikort)

The **bikort** (secondary tax card) is used for additional jobs or income sources beyond your main employment.

**Features**:
- No personal allowance included
- Higher tax deduction rate
- Used for second jobs, freelance work, or additional income
- Can have multiple bikort for different employers

**Typical tax rate**: ~55%

**Important**: The high bikort rate ensures you don't underpay taxes during the year. You'll receive a refund when filing your annual tax return if too much was withheld.

## How to Apply for a Tax Card

### Prerequisites

Before applying for a tax card, ensure you have:

1. **CPR number**: You must be registered in Denmark's civil registration system
2. **MitID**: Denmark's digital identity system for accessing government services
3. **Employment information**: Details about your employer and expected income

### Application Steps

#### Step 1: Access TastSelv (SKAT's Online Portal)

1. Go to [skat.dk](https://www.skat.dk/)
2. Click "Log ind" (Log in)
3. Log in using your MitID
4. Navigate to "Skattekort" (Tax card) section

#### Step 2: Register Your Employment

1. Select "Skattekort" from the main menu
2. Choose "Ret skattekort" (Edit tax card)
3. Enter your employer's information:
   - Employer name
   - CVR number (company registration number)
   - Expected annual income from this employer
4. Specify whether this is your main job (hovedkort) or secondary job (bikort)

#### Step 3: Review and Confirm

1. Review the calculated tax deduction percentage
2. Check that your personal allowance is correctly applied (for hovedkort)
3. Confirm and save your tax card settings
4. Your employer will automatically receive the updated tax card information

#### Step 4: Inform Your Employer

1. Notify your employer that your tax card is ready
2. Provide your CPR number to your employer
3. Your employer will retrieve your tax card electronically from SKAT

### Alternative: Automatic Tax Card

If you don't set up a tax card before starting work, SKAT will automatically create one based on:
- Your previous year's income (if applicable)
- Standard tax rates for your municipality
- Default personal allowance

**Recommendation**: Always review and adjust your automatic tax card to ensure accuracy.

## Configuring Your Tax Card

### Setting Your Expected Income

Accurate income estimation is crucial for correct tax withholding:

1. **Estimate annual income**: Calculate your expected gross annual salary
2. **Include all income sources**: Salary, bonuses, benefits, freelance income
3. **Update regularly**: Adjust if your income changes significantly

**Why it matters**: If your estimated income is too low, you'll underpay taxes and owe money at year-end. If too high, you'll overpay and receive a refund.

### Assigning Main vs. Secondary Tax Card

**Main tax card (Hovedkort)**:
- Assign to your highest-paying job
- Receives your personal allowance
- Lower tax rate

**Secondary tax card (Bikort)**:
- Assign to additional jobs or income sources
- No personal allowance
- Higher tax rate (~55%)

**Example**: If you work full-time (400,000 DKK/year) and part-time (50,000 DKK/year), assign hovedkort to the full-time job and bikort to the part-time job.

### Adding Deductions

You can add certain deductions to your tax card to reduce monthly tax withholding:

**Common deductions**:
- **Commuting expenses**: If you travel more than 24 km each way to work
- **A-kasse fees**: Unemployment insurance membership
- **Union fees**: Trade union membership
- **Interest expenses**: Mortgage or loan interest

**How to add**:
1. In TastSelv, go to "Fradrag" (Deductions)
2. Select the type of deduction
3. Enter the expected annual amount
4. Save changes

## Common Questions

### Do I need to apply for a tax card every year?

No. Your tax card continues from year to year unless you make changes. However, you should review it annually to ensure:
- Income estimates are accurate
- Deductions are up to date
- Employer information is correct

### What happens if I don't have a tax card?

If you start working without a tax card, your employer will withhold tax at a high default rate (typically ~55%). You'll receive a refund when you file your annual tax return, but it's better to set up a tax card to avoid overpaying throughout the year.

### Can I change my tax card during the year?

Yes. You can update your tax card at any time through TastSelv. Changes typically take effect within 1-2 business days. Update your tax card whenever your circumstances change.

### What if I'm taxed too much or too little?

- **Too much tax withheld**: You'll receive a refund when SKAT issues your annual tax assessment (årsopgørelse) in June
- **Too little tax withheld**: You'll owe additional tax, payable by August

To avoid large adjustments, keep your tax card updated with accurate income estimates.

### How do I know if my tax card is correct?

Check your monthly payslip:
- Compare tax deductions to expected rates
- Verify that personal allowance is being applied (for hovedkort)
- Ensure deductions (commuting, A-kasse, etc.) are reflected

If something seems wrong, log in to TastSelv to review and adjust your tax card.

### What is the difference between frikort and skattekort?

**Frikort** (free card) is a special tax card for low-income earners:
- Available if annual income is below personal allowance (~49,700 DKK in 2025)
- No tax is withheld from salary
- Automatically applied if you qualify
- Useful for students and part-time workers with low income

## Important Deadlines

- **Before starting work**: Set up tax card as soon as you have CPR number and MitID
- **Throughout the year**: Update tax card whenever circumstances change
- **January**: Review tax card for new year
- **When changing jobs**: Update tax card immediately
- **Annual tax return**: Filed automatically by SKAT; review in March-May
