## Common Questions

### Do I need to file a tax return?

No. In Denmark, SKAT automatically prepares your årsopgørelse based on information reported by employers, banks, and other institutions. You only need to review it and make corrections if necessary. There's no separate "filing" process like in some other countries.

### What if I don't review my årsopgørelse?

If you don't review or make corrections by May 1, SKAT will finalize your assessment based on the preliminary version. If the information is correct, this is fine. However, you may miss opportunities to claim deductions or correct errors.

### Can I get help reviewing my årsopgørelse?

Yes. You can get help from:
- **SKAT**: Phone support or in-person appointments
- **Tax advisors**: Professional assistance for complex situations
- **A-kasse**: Many unemployment funds offer tax help to members
- **Your employer**: Payroll department can explain income reporting

### What if I disagree with my final årsopgørelse?

If you disagree with your final assessment after June:
1. **File a complaint** (klage) with SKAT
2. **Provide documentation** supporting your position
3. **SKAT reviews** and may adjust the assessment
4. **Appeal**: Can appeal SKAT's decision to tax tribunal if needed

**Deadline**: Typically 3 months from final assessment date

### How long does it take to receive my refund?

Refunds are usually paid within a few days of the final assessment in June. The money is deposited directly into your NemKonto (registered bank account). If you haven't received your refund within 2 weeks, check that your NemKonto is correctly registered.

### What if I owe tax but can't pay?

Contact SKAT before the August deadline to:
- Request a payment plan (installments)

SKAT may approve a payment plan allowing you to pay over several months.
