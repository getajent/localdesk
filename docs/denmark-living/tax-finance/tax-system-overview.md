## Overview

The Danish tax system is a progressive taxation system where residents pay income tax, labor market contribution (**AM-bidrag**), and municipal tax on their earnings. Denmark has relatively high tax rates compared to many countries, but these taxes fund comprehensive public services including healthcare, education, unemployment benefits, and social welfare programs. Understanding the tax structure is essential for all residents working or earning income in Denmark.

## Key Information

- **Who needs this**: All residents earning income in Denmark
- **When to do this**: Register with **SKAT** (Danish Tax Authority) immediately upon receiving a CPR number
- **Prerequisites**: 
  - CPR number (civil registration number)
  - Employment or income source in Denmark
- **Tax year**: Follows the calendar year (January 1 - December 31)
- **Payment method**: Taxes are automatically deducted from salary by employers

## Components of Danish Taxation

The Danish tax system consists of three main components that are deducted from your gross income:

### 1. AM-bidrag (Labor Market Contribution)

**AM-bidrag** (Arbejdsmarkedsbidrag) is an 8% tax on gross income that funds labor market programs and unemployment benefits.

- **Rate**: 8% of gross income
- **Applied to**: All employment income, self-employment income, and certain benefits
- **Deducted**: Before calculating income tax
- **Purpose**: Funds unemployment insurance system and labor market initiatives

**Example**: If your gross monthly salary is 40,000 DKK, you pay 3,200 DKK in AM-bidrag (40,000 × 0.08).

### 2. Income Tax (Indkomstskat)

Income tax in Denmark is progressive and consists of two levels:

#### Bottom Tax (Bundskat)
- **Rate**: Approximately 12.09% (2025 rate)
- **Applied to**: All taxable income after AM-bidrag deduction
- **National tax**: Collected by the Danish state

#### Top Tax (Topskat)
- **Rate**: 15% (2025 rate)
- **Applied to**: Income exceeding the top tax threshold
- **Threshold**: Approximately 588,900 DKK per year (2025)
- **Progressive**: Only income above the threshold is taxed at this rate

### 3. Municipal Tax (Kommuneskat)

Municipal tax varies by municipality and funds local services such as schools, childcare, elderly care, and local infrastructure.

- **Rate**: Varies by municipality, typically 22-27%
- **Average rate**: Approximately 25%
- **Applied to**: All taxable income after AM-bidrag deduction
- **Local variation**: Check your specific municipality's rate

**Example municipalities**:
- Copenhagen: ~25.4%
- Aarhus: ~25.8%
- Odense: ~25.5%
- Aalborg: ~25.0%

## Total Tax Calculation

Your total tax burden depends on your income level and municipality. Here's how taxes are calculated:

### Calculation Steps

1. **Start with gross income**
2. **Deduct AM-bidrag** (8%)
3. **Calculate taxable income** (gross income - AM-bidrag)
4. **Apply bottom tax** (~12.09%) to taxable income
5. **Apply municipal tax** (~25%) to taxable income
6. **Apply top tax** (15%) to income above threshold (if applicable)

### Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Annual gross income of 500,000 DKK in Copenhagen (25.4% municipal tax)

1. **Gross income**: 500,000 DKK
2. **AM-bidrag** (8%): 40,000 DKK
3. **Taxable income**: 460,000 DKK (500,000 - 40,000)
4. **Bottom tax** (12.09%): 55,614 DKK
5. **Municipal tax** (25.4%): 116,840 DKK
6. **Top tax**: 0 DKK (income below threshold)
7. **Total tax**: 212,454 DKK
8. **Net income**: 287,546 DKK
9. **Effective tax rate**: ~42.5%

### Effective Tax Rates by Income Level

Approximate effective tax rates (including AM-bidrag, bottom tax, and municipal tax):

- **300,000 DKK/year**: ~38-40%
- **500,000 DKK/year**: ~42-44%
- **700,000 DKK/year**: ~47-49% (top tax applies)
- **1,000,000 DKK/year**: ~50-52%

*Note: Rates vary by municipality and individual circumstances*
