## Shopping Customs and Etiquette

### Bag Your Own Groceries

In Denmark, customers bag their own groceries at checkout. Cashiers scan items quickly, and you're expected to pack your bags efficiently. Bring reusable bags or purchase them at the store.

### Plastic Bags Cost Extra

Plastic bags are not free in Denmark. Most stores charge 2-5 DKK per bag. Bring reusable shopping bags to save money and reduce waste.

### Return Bottles and Cans for Deposit

Denmark has a **pant** (deposit) system for bottles and cans:
- Small bottles/cans: 1 DKK deposit
- Large bottles: 3 DKK deposit
- Return empties at reverse vending machines (**pantautomat**) in supermarkets
- Receive a receipt to use toward your purchase or get cash back

### Shopping Cart Deposit

Many stores require a 10 or 20 DKK coin to unlock shopping carts. You get the coin back when you return the cart. This system encourages customers to return carts properly.

### Self-Checkout Options

Most larger supermarkets offer self-checkout stations. These are convenient for small purchases and accept both card and mobile payment.

### Payment Methods

- **Credit/debit cards**: Widely accepted (Dankort, Visa, Mastercard)
- **Mobile payment**: MobilePay is extremely popular in Denmark
- **Cash**: Accepted but less common
- **Contactless payment**: Available at most stores

## Money-Saving Shopping Tips

### Shop at Discount Stores

Discount chains like Netto, Rema 1000, Aldi, and Lidl offer significantly lower prices than premium supermarkets. You can save 20-30% on your grocery bill by shopping at these stores.

### Buy Store Brands

Store-brand products (**kædemærker**) are typically 20-40% cheaper than name brands and often comparable in quality. Look for brands like:
- Netto's "365" line
- Rema 1000's own brand
- Føtex's "Føtex" brand
- Coop's "Coop" and "Coop Änglamark" (organic)

### Check Weekly Offers

All supermarkets publish weekly offers (**tilbudsblade**) online and in-store. Plan your shopping around these deals to maximize savings. Download store apps for digital coupons and personalized offers.

### Use Loyalty Programs

Many chains offer loyalty programs with discounts and rewards:
- **Coop medlemskort**: Discounts at SuperBrugsen, Dagli'Brugsen, and other Coop stores
- **Salling Plus**: Rewards at Føtex, Netto, and Bilka
- **Rema 1000 app**: Digital coupons and offers

### Shop in the Evening for Discounts

Many stores mark down fresh items (bread, meat, produce) in the evening before closing. Look for yellow **nedsat** (reduced) stickers for discounts of 30-50%.

### Buy Seasonal Produce

Seasonal fruits and vegetables are cheaper and fresher. Danish strawberries in summer and root vegetables in winter offer the best value.

## Specialty Shopping

### Organic Products

Denmark has a strong organic food culture. Look for the **Ø-mærket** (organic label):
- Most supermarkets have organic sections
- Discount stores like Lidl and Aldi offer affordable organic options
- Specialty organic stores include Aarstiderne and local health food shops

### International Foods

For international ingredients:
- **Asian supermarkets**: Found in larger cities, offering Asian groceries
- **Middle Eastern shops**: Halal meat and Middle Eastern ingredients
- **Kvickly and Meny**: Good selection of international products
- **Online**: Nemlig.com and other online grocers deliver international items

### Farmers Markets

**Torvehandel** (market trade) offers fresh, local produce:
- Weekly farmers markets in most cities
- Fresh vegetables, fruits, flowers, and artisan products
- Typically Wednesday and Saturday mornings
- Prices comparable to supermarkets but higher quality

### Bakeries

Danish bakeries (**bagerier**) are everywhere:
- Fresh bread, pastries, and **rugbrød** (rye bread)
- Higher quality than supermarket bakeries
- Slightly more expensive but worth it for fresh bread
