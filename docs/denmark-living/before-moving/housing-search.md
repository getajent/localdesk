## Common Questions

### Can I find housing before arriving in Denmark?

Yes, but it's challenging. Many landlords prefer to meet tenants in person. Consider securing temporary housing (sublet, Airbnb) for first month while searching in person.

### Do I need a CPR number to rent an apartment?

Not always, but many landlords prefer tenants with CPR numbers. Some accept employment contracts and passport. Sublets and temporary housing more flexible.

### How long does it take to find housing?

Varies greatly: 1 week to 3+ months depending on location, budget, and flexibility. Copenhagen typically takes longest. Start searching early and be patient.

### What if I can't afford the upfront costs?

Consider shared housing (lower costs), negotiate payment plan with landlord, or seek temporary housing while saving. Some employers offer relocation loans.

### Are pets allowed in rental apartments?

Depends on landlord and lease agreement. Many landlords prohibit pets or allow only small pets. Always ask before signing lease.

### Can I negotiate rent?

Sometimes, especially for longer lease terms or if apartment has been vacant. More common outside major cities. Always worth polite inquiry.

### What are my rights as a tenant?

Danish law provides strong tenant protections: regulated rent increases, protection against unfair eviction, right to sublet (with permission), deposit protection. See [Rental Contracts](../housing/rental-contracts.md) for details.

## Important Deadlines

- **Notice period**: Typically 3 months for tenant, 6-12 months for landlord
- **Deposit return**: Within 14 days of move-out (if no damages)
- **Rent payment**: Usually due on 1st of month
- **Utility bills**: Monthly or quarterly depending on provider

## Troubleshooting

### Can't find housing within budget

**Problem**: All apartments exceed your budget  
**Solution**: Expand search area to suburbs, consider shared housing, look for smaller apartments, check if employer offers housing assistance.

### Landlords not responding to applications

**Problem**: Sending many applications but no responses  
**Solution**: Improve application quality (professional message, complete documents), respond faster to new listings, expand search criteria, consider using rental agency.

### Scam concerns

**Problem**: Suspicious listing or landlord behavior  
**Solution**: Never pay before viewing and signing contract, verify landlord identity, meet in person, use secure payment methods, report suspicious listings.

### Need housing immediately

**Problem**: Arriving soon without secured housing  
**Solution**: Book Airbnb or hotel for first 2-4 weeks, search intensively in person, attend multiple viewings daily, consider temporary sublet, ask employer for assistance.
