## Common Questions

### Can EU citizens work in Denmark without any paperwork?

Yes, EU/EEA/Swiss citizens can work immediately without a work permit. However, you need to register for a CPR number and tax card to receive salary and pay taxes properly.

### How long does it take to get a work permit?

Processing times vary: Fast-track (2-4 weeks), Pay Limit (4-8 weeks), Positive List (1-3 months). Apply well in advance of your intended start date.

### Can I start working while my application is being processed?

No. You must wait for permit approval before traveling to Denmark and starting work. Working without a valid permit is illegal.

### What if my salary is just below the Pay Limit threshold?

Consider other schemes like Positive List (if your occupation is listed) or Fast-track (if employer is certified). Alternatively, negotiate salary increase with employer.

### Can my family come with me?

Yes. Most work permit schemes allow family reunification, but family members must apply separately and you must meet income and housing requirements.

### What happens if I lose my job?

You have a limited time to find new employment (typically 30-60 days). Notify Danish Immigration Service immediately. If you cannot find new work, you may need to leave Denmark or apply for different permit type.

### Can I be self-employed with a work permit?

Only with Establishment Card or specific permits allowing self-employment. Regular work permits are tied to employment with specific employer.

## Important Deadlines

- **Application timing**: Apply 2-4 months before intended start date
- **Permit renewal**: Apply 3-4 months before current permit expires
- **Job loss notification**: Notify authorities within 7 days of employment termination
- **Appeal deadline**: 4 weeks from rejection decision

## Troubleshooting

### My occupation is not on the Positive List

**Problem**: Your job is not listed on the current Positive List  
**Solution**: Check if you qualify for Pay Limit (high salary) or Fast-track (certified employer) schemes. Consider if your skills match a similar listed occupation.

### Processing is taking longer than expected

**Problem**: Application exceeds normal processing time  
**Solution**: Check status on [nyidanmark.dk](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB). Contact Danish Immigration Service if significantly delayed. Avoid making firm travel plans until approved.

### My employer is not certified for Fast-track

**Problem**: Want Fast-track but employer not certified  
**Solution**: Employer can apply for certification (takes 2-3 months). Meanwhile, apply under different scheme. Consider Pay Limit or Positive List.

### Application was rejected

**Problem**: Work permit application denied  
**Solution**: Review rejection letter carefully. Common reasons include insufficient documentation, salary below threshold, or occupation not qualifying. Can appeal within 4 weeks or reapply addressing rejection reasons.
