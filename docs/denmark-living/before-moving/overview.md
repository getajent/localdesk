## Common Questions

### Do I need a job before moving to Denmark?

**EU citizens**: No, you have the right to move and seek employment. However, having a job makes settling easier.

**Non-EU citizens**: Generally yes, most residence permits require a job offer or admission to a study program before you can apply.

### Can I look for housing before I arrive?

Yes, and it's recommended. Many landlords accept applications from abroad, though some prefer to meet tenants in person. See the [Housing Search guide](housing-search.md) for strategies.

### How much money should I have saved?

Recommended minimum:
- 3 months' rent for deposit
- 1-2 months' rent for first payment
- 2-3 months' living expenses
- Total: Approximately 50,000-80,000 DKK (€6,700-€10,700) depending on location

### Do I need to speak Danish?

Not required for most residence permits, but highly recommended for integration. Many Danes speak excellent English, but Danish is essential for full participation in society and many job opportunities.

### Should I get health insurance before moving?

**EU citizens**: Bring your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) for temporary coverage until you get Danish coverage.

**Non-EU citizens**: Yes, private health insurance is often required for residence permit applications and recommended until Danish coverage begins.
