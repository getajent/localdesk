## Common Questions

### Do I need a visa to visit Denmark?

For short visits (up to 90 days in 180-day period), many nationalities can visit Denmark visa-free under Schengen rules. Check if your nationality requires a Schengen visa for tourism or business visits.

### Can I apply for a residence permit after arriving in Denmark?

Generally no. Non-EU citizens must apply from their home country before traveling. Exceptions exist for certain circumstances (e.g., asylum, special humanitarian reasons).

### How long does it take to get a work permit?

Processing times vary: Fast-track scheme (2-4 weeks), Pay Limit scheme (1-2 months), other schemes (1-3 months). Complex cases may take longer.

### Can my family come with me?

Yes. Most residence permits allow family reunification, but your family members must apply separately and meet specific requirements (income, housing, etc.).

### What happens if my application is rejected?

You receive written explanation of rejection reasons. You can appeal the decision within the deadline (typically 4 weeks) or submit a new application addressing the rejection reasons.

### Can I work while my application is being processed?

No. You cannot work in Denmark until your residence permit is approved and you have arrived in Denmark with the permit.

### Do I need health insurance?

Yes. All residence permit applicants must have health insurance. Once you have a CPR number and are employed or studying, you automatically receive Danish health insurance.

## Important Deadlines

- **EU citizens**: Register within 3 months of arrival if staying longer than 3 months

## Troubleshooting

### My application is taking longer than expected

**Problem**: Processing time exceeds normal timeframe  
**Solution**: Check application status on [nyidanmark.dk](https://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-GB). Contact Danish Immigration Service (SIRI) if significantly delayed. Avoid making travel plans until permit is approved.

### I don't meet the salary requirement

**Problem**: Job offer salary is below threshold for Pay Limit scheme  
**Solution**: Explore other work permit schemes (Positive List, Fast-track). Consider if position qualifies under different criteria. Negotiate salary increase with employer if possible.

### I'm missing required documents

**Problem**: Cannot obtain certain documents from home country  
**Solution**: Contact Danish embassy/consulate for guidance on acceptable alternatives. Some documents may be substituted with sworn statements or alternative proof.

### My permit was rejected

**Problem**: Application denied by Danish Immigration Service  
**Solution**: Review rejection letter carefully. Consider appealing if you believe decision is incorrect (4-week deadline). Address specific rejection reasons if reapplying. Seek legal advice for complex cases.
